you are to write a program that will display information about countries.

all the information is displayed in thje file "countries.csv"

the finished program will:
ask the user for a region:
then
display the following information:
Country,Region,Population,Area (sq. mi.),Pop. Density (per sq. mi.),,Phones (per 1000)

if the user types "quit" the program quits (stops).

we are going to break down the program into parts so we can focus on small coding tasks, then put them back together into a main program. We test each part as we go. Sometimes we will need to try various ways of acheiving our goal, and select the one we like best.

We can version off each part as a back up. 
we can break the program down into various parts as follows:

open the file
read the file and create a list from  the lines in the file

ask the user for a region
display the information




Version 1.
'we are going to make sure we can open the file and display all the information.
tasks:
write code to:
open the file
display all the information on all countries - use a function to display all the inforamtion. call the function display_info.

test your code.

then modify the function so
display only the information desired (Country,Region,Population,Area (sq. mi.),Pop. Density (per sq. mi.),,Phones (per 1000)).

Version 2.
back up version 1.
the modify version as follows.
modify the function so it takes a parameter - the region, and only displays the inforamtion for countries in that region.

test your function.

add code to:
ask the user for a region, then display info on that region.


Version 3.
back up version 2
Modify version 2 so the programs repeats asking for a region until the user types quit , or something similar.


Version 4.
entering the region is long and its easy to make errors.
modify the code so the user is shown the lsit of regions first.
give each region a number so the user types only the number.
The user types -1 to quit.
